# ModularNeuralNet

A custom-built modular neural network from scratch using only NumPy to classify heart disease from clinical data, achieving 99% accuracy. Includes training loop, evaluation metrics, and model saving.

## Key Features

- Custom neural network architecture with any number of layers and neurons
- Supports activation functions like ReLU, Tanh, and Sigmoid
- Manual forward and backward propagation using NumPy
- Training with batch gradient descent
- Evaluates model with accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and loss
- Confusion matrix and prediction vs. actual visualizations
- Model saving and loading functionality
